# Lock Smart Proposal

## Overview of Lock Smart - What is it?

When in search of the best way to protect our houses, it has always been using a physical lock as it boasts simplicity and effectiveness. However, not all locks are made equal, and all of them require the analog presence of an authorized user, which are our family members. As we approach a more modern and competitive Singapore, the need of a smart system to remotely grant access to individuals we do not fully trust may be required, such as our babiesâ€™ nanny, package delivery man, friends etc.  How can we allow people to achieve this goal without breaking the bank, while maintaining digital and analog security? 

Lock Smart is a reliable lock that can be unlocked remotely, either through mobile devices or computers, while allowing authorized users to use it as simple as traditional analog locks. Lock Smart features advanced security protocols such as data encryption and 2-factor authentication. Due to the nature of such a device, it is part of the Internet of Things (IoT) that easily integrates into our home networks without being intrusive. 

## Features of Lock Smart 
	
We have referred to the IoT security requirement Category of Technical Reference 64 (TR64) while designing the features of our system. We have decided to consider three main factors while designing this product - Data Protection (DP), Access Protection (AP) and Security Management (MT). Some of these may depend on other basic categories, and as such may be required to reference to in the future.
